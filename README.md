# 🎗️ Breast Cancer Prediction Web App  

A machine learning project that predicts whether a tumor is **Benign (non-cancerous)** or **Malignant (cancerous)** using the Breast Cancer dataset. This project includes a trained ML model, a Jupyter Notebook for training & analysis, and a **Streamlit web application** for easy predictions.  

## 📌 Features  
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline: data preprocessing, visualization, model training & evaluation, deployment with Streamlit  
- User-friendly **web app interface**  
- Prediction results shown clearly: ✅ Benign or ⚠️ Malignant
